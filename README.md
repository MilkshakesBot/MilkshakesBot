### Hi, I'm James (aka MilkshakesBot). <img src = "wave.gif" width = 20px>

I have a degree in General Studies with minors in both Digital Forensics and Psychology from UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). 

#### What I am currently working on / learning:

- Primarly what I am tikering and playing around with is profiling and testing Minecraft Server JVM flags to determine the validity of if they are useful or useless. I have a few other side projects I am working on right now but do not want to disclose them yet.

##### So where else to find me?
